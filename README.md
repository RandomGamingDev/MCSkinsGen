# MCSkinsGen
A repository for a Minecraft skin generator based off of Stable Diffusion v1.5. It's trained off of Stable Diffusion and uses data scraped with https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/mcskins-net-scraper

This is prototype 2.

I've trained up to epoch 18, but I haven't had enough computing power to train past that (Google Colab does a funni and kicks me off and I don't have a GPU powerful enough to train the AI)

The model will try to follow the prompt, but currently does so very very loosely if at all in a lot of cases.
